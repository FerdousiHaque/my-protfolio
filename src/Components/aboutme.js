      <p>
      My name is Ferdousi Haque. I am a dreamer and believer. I am well known for working hard and complete work in time by any cost. I eagerly wait to learn new things. I can speak well both in English and Bangla. Another quality of mine is that, I like to take challenge and overcome the challenge by investing time and effort. I find it difficult to refuse people when it’s about helping them.
      I was born in Khulna, Bangladesh. I’ve spent most of my life in Khulna and completed my BSc. Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering from Khulna University in January, 2020.
